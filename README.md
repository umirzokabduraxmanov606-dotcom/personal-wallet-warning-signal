## 📌 Overview (English)

**Personal Wallet Warning Signal** is an original security concept designed to protect cryptocurrency users — especially beginners — from one of the most common scams: sending funds to a **personal (EOA) or non-exchange wallet** controlled by fraudsters.

Unlike existing tools such as Etherscan Risk Alert, which notify users **after** a transaction is broadcast, this system operates **before the transaction occurs**, analyzing the destination address and alerting the user in real time.

## ❗ Problem

Thousands of crypto users lose funds each year by unknowingly sending tokens to scam-controlled personal wallets.  
Current solutions only detect risks **after** a transaction is confirmed. This system fills a critical security gap by acting **proactively.**

## 🧠 Solution – Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Address Validation** – Checks wallet address format, length, and blockchain type (e.g., TRC20 / ERC20).  
2. **Exchange Registry Check** – Compares the destination address against a verified database of known custodial/exchange addresses.  
3. **EOA vs Custodial Detection** – Identifies whether the address is a personal wallet (EOA) or custodial.  
4. **Risk Analysis & Blacklist Check** – Checks scam reports, phishing data, and assigns a risk score.  
5. **New User Sensitivity Layer** – Applies stricter rules if the sender is a new account (e.g., fewer than 5 transactions).  
6. **Decision & Warning Signal** –  
   - ⚠️ “This address appears to be personal or unverified. Scam risk detected.”  
   - ❌ Cancel → Transaction stops.  
   - ✅ Proceed → Requires 2FA and a short delay before sending.  
7. **Logging & Analytics** – Records all actions (address, risk score, decision, timestamp) for security improvement.
